title: if, while & Boolean algebra
---

There are many learning and practice resources for Python on the web,
often fee to use. Examples are [www.snakify.org](http://www.snakify.org)
, [www.w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com) ,
[www.freecodecamp.org](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and
[www.realpython.com](http://www.realpython.com) . Please do make use of
them

# Section -- if

## Part 1

You can type 'if' statements directly into IDLE and execute them. Try
this:

> \>\>\> if 'three' \> 'four':
>
> print(" 'three' \> 'four' ")

That's great just for trying-things-out but usually you will want to
save your work in a script, or better still, generalise the algorithm
and wrap it into a reusable function definition:

Create and test these functions in a python file named w3starter.py

> def my_max_v1(a,b):
>
> if a \> b:
>
> return a
>
> if b \>= a
>
> return b
>
> def my_max_v2(a,b):
>
> if a \> b:
>
> return a
>
> return b
>
> my-max = my_max_v2

Here are few more simple functions using 'if' to practice with:

> def grade_v1(mark):
>
> \"\"\" Pass or Fail? \"\"\"
>
> if mark \> 60:
>
> return \'Pass\'
>
> return \'Fail\'
>
> def weather_v1(a_str):
>
> \"\"\" take umbrella? \"\"\"
>
> if \'rain\' in a_str:
>
> return \'Take umbrella\'
>
> def weather_v2(a_str):
>
> \"\"\" rain or shine? \"\"\"
>
> if \'rain\' in a_str:
>
> return \'Take umbrella\'
>
> if \'sun\' in a_str:
>
> return \'Take sunscreen\'
>
> return 'Look outside and guess'
>
> def exec_decider(deadline_today=True):
>
> if deadline_today:
>
> return \'Do it now!\'
>
> return \'maÃ±ana\'

Run w3starter.py then, after checking the functions you wrote are now in
memory by using the built-in function dir(), type this code into the
IDLE interactive shell. Is the result what you expected?

> \>\>\>
>
> \>\>\> my_max( \'three\' \> \'four\')
>
> \>\>\> my_max(3, 4)

Test your functions to make sure they work as anticipated.

## Part 2 -- else

> def grade_v2(mark):
>
> \"\"\" Pass or Fail? \"\"\"
>
> if mark \> 60:
>
> return \'Pass\'
>
> else:
>
> return \'Fail\'

## Part 3 - elif

> def grade_v3(mark):
>
> if student_mark \> 80:
>
> grade = 'starship captain'
>
> else:
>
> if student_mark \> 80:
>
> grade = 'astronaut'
>
> else:
>
> if student_mark \> 60:
>
> grade = 'aeronaut'
>
> else:
>
> if student_mark \> 40:
>
> grade = 'earthling'
>
> else:
>
> grade = 'oh deary, deary me'
>
> def grade_v4(mark):
>
> if student_mark \> 80:
>
> grade = 'Starship Captain'
>
> elif student_mark \> 80:
>
> grade = 'Astronaut'
>
> elif student_mark \> 60:
>
> grade = 'Aeronaut'
>
> elif student_mark \> 40:
>
> grade = 'Earthling'
>
> else:
>
> grade = 'Oh deary, deary me'

## Section -- Boolean Algebra

Evaluate these Boolean equations on paper, then confirm by executing
them in IDLE:

> .\>\>\> a = True
>
> \>\>\> b = True
>
> \>\>\> a and b
>
> \>\>\> a or b
>
> \>\>\> not a and b
>
> \>\>\> not a or b
>
> \>\>\> not not not not a
>
> \>\>\> a and not a
>
> \>\>\> a or not a

## Section - Truth Tables and Venn Diagrams

These can be helpful when evaluating Boolean expressions in 'if'
statements and elsewhere. Not assessed but very handy tools when you
need them. For instance:

> (a or not b) and (not b or not a) or (b and not a)

That said though, it is good practice to design your code so that
Boolean conditions are individually simple.

## Section -- while statements

Try these examples:

> def counting(upto = 10):
>
> counter = 0
>
> while counter \< upto:
>
> print(counter)
>
> counter = counter + 1
>
> return
>
> \# end of indented code marks end of while loop

Print just the vowels and spaces in a string:

> Def print_vowels(a_str):
>
> a_str = \'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\'
>
> vowels = \'aeiou \' \# note the space at end of string
>
> index = 0
>
> while index \< len(a_str):
>
> if a_str\[index\] in vowels:
>
> print(a_str\[index\], end = '')
>
> else:
>
> print('\_', end = '')
>
> index = index + 1

Printing the characters of an alphabet:

> def alphabet_v1():
>
> char_code = ord(\'a\')
>
> stop = char_code + 26
>
> while char_code \<= stop:
>
> print(chr(char_code), end = '')
>
> char_code = char_code + 1

And other character sets:

> def alphabet_v2(start_code, stop_code):
>
> """Get start_code & stop_code from unicode.org/charts. Numbers are
> hexadecimal so precede number with 0x e.g. alphabet_v2(0x00ff"""
>
> counter = start_code
>
> while counter \<= stop_code:
>
> print(chr(counter), end = '')
>
> counter = counter + 1
>
> counter = 0
>
> while counter \< upto:
>
> print(counter)
>
> counter = counter + 1
>
> return
>
> \# end of indented code marks end of while loop

## Part 2

There are four temperature scales in common use: **K**elvin,
**C**entigrade, **R**ankine, **F**ahrenheit.

The conversion factors between these temperature scales are:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  From                To                    Formula
  ------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------
  Kelvin              Rankine               Kelvin \*9/5

  Rankine             Fahrenheit            Rankine - 459.67

  Fahrenheit          Celsius               (Fahrenheit -32) \*5/9

  Celsius             Kelvin                Centigrade + 273.15
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your task is to design, write and test a function for each of these
conversions. Call them k2r(), r2f(), f2c() and c2k(). Save them all in
the same file called temp_conv.py

# Section 2 -- scope

Open a new python script and call it scope.py and save this program into
it:

> \# define a variable that is external to all functions
>
> a = 5

Now explore what happens when we use the same name INSIDE \# function
definitions

> def scope1():\
> return a

Function scope1() returns the value of the variable \'a\' that exists
only in its external namespace\"\"\"

> def scope2():\
> a = 27\
> return a

Function scope2() defines and return an internal variable \'a\'. This
masks/hides the external name \'a\' and its value. After executing this
function the value of external \'a\' is unaffected\"\"\"

> def scope3(): \# throws syntax error when called\
> a = a + 1\
> return a

Function scope3() attempts to increment value of a variable named \'a\'
but this fails with syntax error \"local variable \'a\' referenced
before assignment\".

Reading the expression left to right (as Python does) we are asking
Python to create a variable named \'a\' which masks external \'a\' and
then assign it a value of one more than its current value. But at that
point the new \'a\' doesn\'t properly exist and certainly doesn\'t have
a value - hence Python objects that we are trying to use (reference)
\'a\' before it has been assigned a value.

> def scope4(): \# using the keyword 'global'\
> global a\
> a = a + 1\
> return a

The 'global' keyword is a rich source of bugs so please AVOID using it.

Use of the \'global\' keyword links the internal name \'a\' to the
external scope. The variable name \'a\' can then be used and assigned
values but it is changing the external \'a\' at the same time as the
local value. Check the value of external \'a\' after running this
function.

Execute scope.py and use dir() to see what is in memory. Then execute
these functions in IDLE and explain the results you get:

> \>\>\> scope1()
>
> \>\>\> scope2()
>
> \>\>\> scope3()
>
> \>\>\> scope4()

Now delete the variable a from memory in IDLE

> \>\>\> del(a)
>
> \>\>\> scope1()

Explain why it did execute but now it doesn't

# Section 3-- reusing functions

## Part 1

Open the python file starter.py in IDLE and add these functions:

> def times5(a_number):
>
> \"\"\" Return five times a_number \"\"\"
>
> return times2(a_number) + times3(a_number)
>
> def times6(a_number):
>
> \"\"\" Return six times a_number \"\"\"
>
> return times2( times3( a_number ) )

Test that they work correctly.

## Part 2

Your task is to design and write the functions k2c() and f2r() which
convert temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius and from Fahrenheit to
Rankine by reusing ONLY the temperature conversion functions you built
in part 1.

Open the python file temp_conv.py in IDLE, add these functions, and test
that they work.

# Section 4-- parameters

## Part 1

Create and save these functions in a python file named params.py

> def parms_v1(num1, num2, num3):
>
> \"\"\" there can be any number of parameters \"\"\"
>
> return num1 + (num2 \* num3)
>
> def parms_v2(num1, num2, num3 = 1):
>
> \"\"\" Third parameter is optional \"\"\"
>
> return num1 + (num2 \* num3)

Test them to make sure they work as anticipated. For instance:

> parms_v2(4,5,6),
>
> parms_v2(4,5),
>
> parms_v2(1, num3 = 0, num2 = 11),
>
> parms_v2(0, 17, 2),
>
> parms_v2(num2 = 17, num3 = 2, num1 = 0)

Check the values returned to be sure you understand what is happening.

## Part 2 -- parameters can be any type

Parameter values can be any type of object, including other functions.

In this example the default value of the parameter hash is the built-in
function hash()

> def mod00hash(object1, hash=hash):
>
> return hash(str1)%100

Create and save this function in the file params.py new python file.

Then execute these calls to the function to confirm it is working
correctly:

> mod00hash (5)
>
> mod00hash ('5')
>
> mod00hash ('six')
>
> mod00hash ('six', hash)
>
> mod00hash ('six', id) \# the built-in function id()

Explain the results you get.

# Section 5 -- return values

Part 1 -- none, one or many return values

Create and save these functions in a python file named return_values.py

> def no_return():
>
> pass
>
> def empty_return():
>
> return
>
> def single_return():
>
> return 'single value returned'
>
> def many_return():
>
> return 'as', 'many', 'values', 'as', 'is', 'needed'

Execute the python script and test that the functions work.

Determine the type of the values returned by these functions using the
built-in function type()

> type(no_return())
>
> type(empty_return())
>
> type(single_return())
>
> type(many_return())

Explain the following statements and the values they return:

> len(single_return())
>
> single_return()\[7:12\]
>
> len(many_return())
>
> many_return()\[2\]\[3\]

## Part 2 -- functions can return any object

This means that functions can create and return other functions. Add
this function to return_values.py:

> def nopoints():
>
> def inner_function():
>
> return \'zero points\'
>
> return inner_function

Now execute these statements and explain the results

> f = nopoints()
>
> type(f)
>
> type(f())
>
> f()

# Section 6 -- importing and reusing code

## Part 1 -- reusing your code

Create a new python file called starter2.py and import the module
starter.py you created earlier with the statement:

> import starter

After running that module in IDLE then evaluate these two expressions:

> dir() \# the name 'starter' is visible
>
> dir(starter) \# lists objects in object with name 'starter'.

We can now use these imported objects (functions in this case) in this
module, starter2.py:

> def times4(a_value):
>
> \"\"\"demonstrate use of imported function\"\"\"
>
> return starter.times2(a_value)+starter.times2(a_value)
>
> times7(a_value):
>
> pass \# you do this
>
> times11(a_value):
>
> pass \# you do this
>
> times11(a_value):
>
> pass \# you do this

Test that they work.

## Part 2 -- the python turtle (fun)

Create a new python script and call it turtle1.py and add this fun piece
of code:

> from turtle import \*
>
> def sq(pencolor, fillcolor):
>
> color(pencolor, fillcolor)
>
> begin_fill()
>
> forward(200)
>
> left(90)
>
> forward(200)
>
> left(90)
>
> forward(200)
>
> left(90)
>
> forward(200)
>
> end_fill()

Use IDLE to execute this program and test it works by calling the
function sq()

\>\>\> sq(\'blue\', \'green\') \# choose any standard color

There are many fun Turtle tutorials on the web.

## Part 3 -- random

Use the random package to create the function dice() which simulates
throwing a many sided dice:

> import random \# from the standard library
>
> def dice(sides=6):
>
> return random.randint(1,sides)

Create a new python script called dice.py and write and test the dice()
function.

> dice()
>
> \# call dice() several times to confirm it only\
> \# returns integer values between 1 and 6
>
> dice(10)
>
> \# call dice(10) several times to confirm it only\
> \# returns integer values between 1 and 10

In the IDLE interactive shell execute these statements

> \>\>\> import random
>
> \>\>\> fruits = 'apple pear orange mango melon grape'

Then execute this statement several times

> \>\>\> random.choice(fruits.split())

Explain what is going on.
