    Plainly this is a next to impossible task as English, in common with most
    languages, has an almost limitless supply of exceptions to any set of
    pluralization rules that you might craft.
    Your objective therefore should be to deliver a function that plualizes
    'lots' of words in a 'reasonably modest' amount of code.
    We will learn how to test this function effectively in w4."""
