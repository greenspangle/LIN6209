"""" LIN6209 Week 1 Assignment. Due the day before our week 2 lesson.

1. Install Python version 3 on your personal computer or laptop.
    www.python.org
    Follow the instructions and accept all the defaults.
    Confirm it is working

2. Review the names of the 'built-in' python functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
   You do NOT need to study these in detail, just scan the names.
   int(), float(), str(), bool(), len(), input() and print() you have already met.
   Many of the others have names that may seem meaningless but several you can guess from their names.
   You might guess that 'sorted()' will sort things into order - and you would be right.
   If you guessed reversed() sorts into reverse order - you would be right again.
   Try them to see exactly what you get e.g sorted('abracadabra')
   The output is a 'list' which we will study in lesson 3. You can put it back into a string with this statement:
   '-'.join(sorted('abracadabra'))
   You can replace the separator string '-' with whatever you want, even the empty string '' works.

3. Skim through the string methods https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str
    You do NOT need to study these in detail. Just get an impression of the range of capabilities available.
    For instance 'my string'.count() counts substrings in 'my string', 'my string'.lower() coverts all the
    characters to lower-case, 'my string'.upper() does the opposite, 'my string'.split() splits it into parts.
    Try a few. Now read the documentation and try again.
   

4. Go to https://snakify.org/en/  and create an account
    You should be able to do all the exercises in sections
        1 Input, print and numbers
        2 Integer and float numbers
        5 Strings (except the last one 'delete every third character')
    

You do not need to submit any evidence of completing these tasks - your word is your bond.
For each question you complete, just change the relevant assignment statement from False to True

VERY IMPORTANT
    -- For each exercise you attempt, change the variable value from False to True
    -- DO NOT change the names of the variables
    -- ALL of these variables must be submitted in a single python file
    -- The name of the python script you submit MUST BE
           19290005_LIN6209_1.py (where x..x is your student number)
